# Plotting_chiral_response
   This package prepares chiral response contributions to be plotted as
 cub files

   'orb000001.cub' contains information about the orbitals contributing
 with the electric dipole to the chiral response.

   'orb000002.cub' contains information about the orbitals contributing
 with the magnetic dipole to the chiral response.
