# Plotting_chiral_response
   This package prepares chiral response contributions to be plotted as
 cub files.

   The input files required are:
- '.out' generated by NWChem with the blocks:
  - Integral dipol matrices mu_x, mu_y, mu_z, m_x, m_y, and m_z for the
    electric and magnetic spatial components (direct modifications
    within NWChem are required).
  - 'gmovecs' block with the MO coefficents (direct modifications within
    NWChem are required)
  - AO overlap matrix (Can be activated with the line 
    'print "ao overlap"' in the DFT block of the NWChem input.
- '.xyz' with the coordinates of the molecule.
- '.molden' file with the information of the basis to be used as a
  template.
- '.civecs_singlet' file with the CI vector coefficients that are
  required for building the transition density matrix. This is a binary
  file that is read by a fortran program. The name of the file is
  hardwired within the fortran sourcecode.

   'orb000001.cub' contains information about the orbitals contributing
 with the electric dipole to the chiral response.

   'orb000002.cub' contains information about the orbitals contributing
 with the magnetic dipole to the chiral response.
